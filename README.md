# Decentralised-Exchange

# Decentralised Exchange (DEX) Solidity Contracts
This repository contains a simple implementation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) in Solidity, inspired by Uniswap V2. It includes contracts for creating liquidity pools (pairs), managing liquidity, and swapping ERC-20 tokens.

# Overview
The DEX enables users to:

Create unique token pairs (liquidity pools)

Add and remove liquidity to/from pools

Swap tokens via automated market-making (AMM) using a constant product formula

# Contracts
1. Pair.sol
- Core liquidity pool contract managing two tokens.

- Tracks reserves and LP tokens.

- Handles minting and burning of liquidity tokens.

- Implements token swaps with fee and invariant checks.

2. Factory.sol
- Creates and tracks all pairs (liquidity pools).

- Ensures only one unique pair per token combination.

- Uses CREATE2 for deterministic pair addresses.

3. Router.sol
- User-facing contract to interact with pairs.

- Simplifies liquidity adding/removal and token swaps.

- Maintains correct token ratios and implements slippage protection.

- Contains helper functions to calculate swap outputs and optimal liquidity amounts.

#Features
- ERC-20 token support: Uses OpenZeppelin IERC20 interface for token transfers.

- Constant product AMM: Implements x * y = k invariant with a 0.3% swap fee.

- Liquidity tokens: Minted and burned to represent shares of the pool.

- Slippage protection: Users can specify minimum acceptable amounts.

- Deterministic pair deployment: Using CREATE2 to predict pair addresses.

- Gas optimization: Uses uint112 for reserve storage and minimizes redundant calls.

#Usage
- Deploy the Factory contract.

- Deploy the Router contract with the Factory address.

- Create a pair for two tokens via the Factory or Router.

- Add liquidity to a pair through the Router, which transfers tokens and mints LP tokens.

- Swap tokens using the Router's swapTokenForToken function.

- Remove liquidity by burning LP tokens and receiving underlying tokens back.
